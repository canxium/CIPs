### Abstract
This CIP-0001 decribe the technical behind offline mining, what is it and how it work.

# Specification

To mine CAU offline, miners have to go through the following steps:
1. Create or use existed account to recieve reward.
2. Create new Canxium mining account.
3. Choose their desired mining difficulty.
4. Generate new transaction, send from the account created by step 2. 
5. Search for a valid mining nonce.
6. Broadcast or hold the transaction.

We will go into each step in detail, skipping steps 1 and 2 because it's too easy.
- Reciever: `0x5240e646168C56f4cEdd389bbD38A7428Fb3667F`
- Miner: `0x690b9a9e9aa1c9db991c7721a92d351db4fac990`
- Mining contract: `0x66aBcd2775856f0561EB98c4954DBf79048032a4`

### Step 3
In Canxium blockchain, mining reward are paid by mining difficulty. Offline miners are 
free to choose their desired difficulty in accordance with their computing power, however must not be less than a minimum difficulty of 500GH.
The greater difficulty, the greater reward per valid transaction, but the number of transactions will be less.

Suppose we have 100 Antminer E9 Pro, total hashrate is 368 GH/s. We choose the desired mining difficulty: 10 TH (10000000000000 H). On average we will mine a valid transaction every 27 seconds.

### Step 4
Because we develop Canxium base on ethereum, we already have 3 transcation types:
 - Legacy: 0x0
 - Access list: 0x1
 - EIP-1559: 0x2

We will create another transaction for mining type:
 - Mining: 0x3

This will be an example for a mining transaction.
```
types.NewTx(&types.MiningTx{
  ChainID:    3003,
  Nonce:      0,
  GasTipCap:  0,
  GasFeeCap:  0,
  Gas:        100000,
  From:       `0x690b9a9e9aa1c9db991c7721a92d351db4fac990`,
  To:         `0x66aBcd2775856f0561EB98c4954DBf79048032a4`,
  Value:      5000000000000000,
  Data:       `0x819232400000000000000000000000005240e646168c56f4cedd389bbd38a7428fb3667f`,
  Algorithm:  1,
  Difficulty: 10000000000000,
	MixDigest: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`,
	PowNonce: 0,
})
```
- `types.MiningTx` : This struct defines a new mining transaction, type `0x3`.
- `ChainID`        : Define chain id, `3003` is Canxium mainnet.
- `Nonce`          : Account nonce of the mining address `0x690b9a9e9aa1c9db991c7721a92d351db4fac990`
- `GasTipCap`      : Priority fee per gas, mining transaction is gas free, so 0 is valid number.
- `GasFeeCap`      : Gas fee cap, same as `GasTipCap`.
- `Gas`            : This transaction will interact with a smart contract, normally it will be used up to 57,759 Gas.
- `From`           : The mining address, have to be same with the transaction singer to prevent replay attack.
- `To`             : Send this transaction to mining contract, otherwise it will fail.
- `Value`          : Mining reward, have to equal: `Difficulty * 500`.
- `Algorithm`      : Mining algorithm, `1` is Ethash - the only algorithm supported at the present.
- `Difficulty`     : The chosen difficulty.
- `MixDigest`      : The Hashimoto algorithm mixhash, will be set after the we found the random number.
- `PowNonce`       : The random number we found which satisfy the difficulty using Hashimoto algorithm.

Like block mining, before the actual mining takes place, we have to have three things: The SealHash, Random Number and Dataset.
- SealHash is the Keccak-256 hash of the mining transaction data, included all above fields:
```
SealHash = prefixedRlpHash(tx.Type(), []interface{}{
  tx.ChainId(),
  tx.Nonce(),
  tx.GasTipCap(),
  tx.GasFeeCap(),
  tx.Gas(),
  tx.From(),
  tx.To(),
  tx.Value(),
  tx.Data(),
  tx.Algorithm(),
  tx.Difficulty(),
})
```

This will create a unique Sealhash for each transaction send from each mining address we have generated. Every signle change on these field
will result to different SealHash.

- Dataset: The Ethash algorithm require a dataset which generated base on block number, but we're working on transaction and offline, so we don't have the block number. We will
generate this dataset base on the transaction `Nonce`.

### Step 5
After we have these data, we can start searching for the `Random Number` until we satisfy the difficulty like block mining.
```
digest, result := hashimotoFull(Dataset, SealHash, RandomNumber)
if new(big.Int).SetBytes(result).Cmp(target) <= 0 {
  // Correct nonce found, set MixDigest and PowNonce then sign the transaction.
}
```

Because we use the same Hashimoto algorithm with block mining, we make sure that the rewards for offline mining and block mining are the same.
# Transaction Validation
In order to be accepted by the network, mining transaction have to satisfy below requirements.
- `To` address have to match the contract address defined in the genesis file.
- `From` have to match the transaction signer.
- `Difficulty` have to be positive numbers.
- `Difficulty` have to greater than minimum difficulty defined in the genesis file.
- `Value` have to match the formula: `Difficulty * 500`
- `PowNonce` and `MixDigest` have to satisfy Hashimoto algorithm and the chosen `Difficulty`
