### Abstract
This CIP-0002 decribe the technical behind merge mining, what is it and how it work.

## What is Merge-Mining?

**Merge-mining** is a process that allows miners to use the computational work from one blockchain’s proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm to simultaneously contribute to another blockchain. This enables miners to efficiently mine two (or more) blockchains without incurring additional computational costs.

Traditionally, merge-mining is used to secure smaller or newer blockchains by leveraging the hashing power of an already established and secure blockchain. However, **Canxium** introduces a novel twist: instead of focusing on blockchain security, Canxium’s merge-mining centers around **creating new tokens** as evidence of completed PoW workloads.

## Traditional Merge-Mining: An Overview

In traditional merge-mining setups:  
- **Single PoW Problem:** Miners solve a PoW problem that satisfies the difficulty requirements of both blockchains.  
- **Shared Headers:** Miners include the block headers of both blockchains in their computational work, ensuring compatibility.  
- **Dual Validation:** Blocks are submitted to and validated by both blockchains independently, with miners receiving rewards from each network.  

This method is primarily designed to enhance the security of smaller blockchains while maximizing miners' efficiency.

## Canxium Merge-Mining: Unlocking Cross-Chain Synergy  

Canxium redefines merge-mining by focusing on **token creation** rather than blockchain security. Its innovative approach leverages the computational power of other PoW blockchain miners, particularly those in the Litecoin network, to generate **CAU coins** as proof of completed workloads. 

### Key Features of Canxium’s Approach:
- **Token-Centric:** Each CAU coin represents a tangible PoW workload, enhancing the intrinsic value of the Canxium ecosystem.  
- **Cross-Chain Collaboration:** Canxium creates a symbiotic relationship between its ecosystem and other PoW miners, fostering collaboration and growth across blockchains.  
- **Offline Mining Mechanism:** Unlike traditional setups, Canxium integrates a transaction-based validation process (type 0x4 transactions) linked to external PoW results, such as Litecoin blocks.

This reimagined merge-mining model transforms the process from a **security-focused** mechanism to a **decentralized token-generation system.**

## Key Differences: Traditional vs. Canxium Merge-Mining

| **Aspect**                | **Traditional Merge-Mining**                               | **Canxium Merge-Mining**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**        | Enhance blockchain security                                | Generate CAU coins as proof of completed PoW workloads                                  |
| **Mechanics**              | Solve a single PoW problem for both blockchains            | Integrate external PoW results into Canxium’s PoW validation via type 0x4 transactions   |

## **Mining Integration**

### **Purpose**  
To integrate Canxium’s ecosystem with Litecoin/Kaspa, miners act as participants by embedding their Canxium addresses into Litecoin block’s coinbase transactions. This ensures compatibility and establishes a link between the two blockchains.

### **Technical Details**  
- **Coinbase Transaction**:  
  - In Litecoin/Kaspa mining, the coinbase transaction is the first transaction in a block and is used to reward the miner.  
  - Miners modify this transaction to include an Canxium address in the `vout` (output) field for Litecoin, or Payload for Kaspa
  - This Canxium address serves as the recipient of CAU rewards on Canxium.

- **PoW**:
  - Litecoin/Kaspa uses the PoW algorithm, requiring miners to find a hash below a certain target.
  - Miners continue their regular mining process, solving the PoW with no modifications to the mining hardware or algorithm.

### **Key Considerations**:
- Litecoin/Kaspa’s block validation process remains unaffected.
- Miners need software capable of including an Canxium address in the coinbase transaction for merge-mining purposes.

## **Type 0x7E Transaction Creation on Canxium**

### **Purpose**  
A type 0x7E transaction is the mechanism through which Litecoin/Kaspa miners submit proof of their PoW workload to the Canxium blockchain for validation and reward.

### **Transaction Structure**  
A type 0x7E transaction includes:
1. **Litecoin/Kaspa Block Header**:  
   - Contains metadata such as the block hash, timestamp, and difficulty level.
   - Used by Canxium validators to verify the PoW solution.

2. **Canxium Address**:  
   - Extracted from the `vout` or `Payload` of the coinbase transaction in the Litecoin/Kaspa block.
   - Acts as the recipient of the CAU rewards.

3. **Block Difficulty**:  
   - Indicates the computational effort required to mine the Litecoin/Kaspa block.
   - Directly influences the reward calculation on Canxium.

4. **Proof-of-Work Solution**:  
   - Includes the nonce and resulting hash from the Litecoin PoW process.
   - Enables validators to independently verify the solution.

### **Key Considerations**:
- Miners must ensure all required fields are properly formatted.
- Software tools or scripts are needed to automate the creation and submission of type 0x7E transactions.

## **3. Canxium Validator Responsibilities**

### **Purpose**  
Validators ensure the integrity of the merge-mining process by verifying the PoW workload, embedded data, and reward eligibility.

### **Validation Steps**  
1. **Extract Litecoin Block Header**:
   - Parse the block header from the type 0x7E transaction.

2. **Verify Litecoin/Kaspa PoW**:
   - Check if the hash meets Litecoin’s difficulty target.
   - Validate the nonce and hash provided in the block header.

3. **Check Canxium Address**:
   - Confirm the Canxium address is correctly formatted and valid.

4. **Confirm Block Difficulty**:
   - Retrieve the difficulty level of the Litecoin block.
   - Ensure it matches the difficulty provided in the transaction.

5. **Prevent Double-Spending**:
   - Maintain a record of processed Litecoin/Kaspa block headers to prevent miners from submitting the same proof multiple times.

### **Key Considerations**:
- Validators must process type 0x7E transactions efficiently to handle high volumes as adoption grows.
- The validation process must be transparent to build trust within the ecosystem.

## **4. Reward Calculation**

### **Purpose**  
The reward system incentivizes miners by distributing CAU tokens based on their contribution to the PoW workload.

### **Formula**  

```Reward = Base Reward * Block Difficulty ```

- **Base Reward**:  
  - A fixed value defined by Canxium’s monetary policy.
  - Represents the minimum reward for a unit difficulty of PoW.

- **Block Difficulty**:  
  - Reflects the computational effort required to mine the block.
  - Scaled to align with Canxium’s reward system.

### **Reward Distribution**  
1. CAU tokens are minted by Canxium and sent to the Canxium address embedded in the block’s coinbase transaction.
2. Transactions are publicly recorded on the Canxium blockchain for transparency.

### **Key Considerations**:
- The reward system should adjust dynamically to market conditions to remain attractive to miners.
- Validators must ensure rewards are distributed fairly and accurately.

## **5. Handling Edge Cases**

### **Invalid Litecoin Block Header**  
- **Cause**: The block header does not meet the PoW requirements.  
- **Action**: The type 0x7E transaction is rejected by Canxium validators.

### **Malformed Canxium Address**  
- **Cause**: The Canxium address in the coinbase transaction is invalid or improperly formatted.  
- **Action**: The type 0x7E transaction is marked as invalid, transaction is rejected.

### **Duplicate Submissions**  
- **Cause**: A miner attempts to submit the same block header multiple times.  
- **Action**: Validators reject duplicate type 0x7E transactions based on their records.

### **Low Reward Concern**  
- **Cause**: Initial CAU market value may result in rewards being perceived as insignificant.  
- **Solution**: Educate miners about the zero-cost nature of merge-mining and potential CAU appreciation.

## **6. Security Measures**

### **Sybil Resistance**  
- Proof-of-Work ensures that only miners who perform valid computational work can submit type 0x7E transactions.

### **Validation Transparency**  
- All validation steps are recorded on the Canxium blockchain, allowing anyone to audit the process.

### **Scalability**  
- Validators are optimized to handle high volumes of type 0x7E transactions as miner participation increases but no more than 100 mining transaction per block.

## **7. Miner Workflow**

### **Step-by-Step Process**  

1. **Mine a Block**:  
   - Solve the PoW algorithm to create a valid block.
   - Include an Canxium address in the `vout`/`Payload` field of the coinbase transaction.

2. **Prepare a Type 0x7E Transaction**:  
   - Extract the block header, difficulty, caclulate the transaction merkle tree proof and embedded Canxium address.
   - Construct a type 0x7E transaction with the required fields.

3. **Submit the Transaction to Canxium**:  
   - Broadcast the type 0x7E transaction to the Canxium network.

4. **Wait for Validation**:  
   - Validators confirm the validity of the submitted proof.

5. **Receive Rewards**:  
   - Once validated, CAU tokens are transferred to the embedded Canxium address.

## **8. Benefits of Canxium Merge-Mining**

- **Zero Additional Cost**: Miners leverage existing operations to earn CAU tokens.  
- **Decentralized Token Creation**: Each CAU represents evidence of completed PoW workloads.  
- **Interoperability**: Builds bridges between Litecoin and Canxium, fostering ecosystem growth.  
- **Incentive for Early Adoption**: The low barrier to entry encourages Litecoin miners to participate.

```
A valid merge mining transaction contains the following key fields:
- **type**: Type of transaction, specific to merge-mining ("0x7e").
- **Value (`value`)**: The reward amount calculated as `reward per difficulty * difficulty`.
- **Input Data (`data`)**: Encoded in the format of the `mergeMining(address,uint16,uint256)` method:
  - Method signature: `0x2979ee24`
  - `receiver` padded to 32 bytes
  - `chain` (16-bit, padded to 32 bytes)
  - `timestamp` (256-bit, padded to 32 bytes)
- **auxPoW**: Kaspa block details
  - `header`: Kaspa block header
  - `merkleProof`: Merkle tree path to verify coinbase hash if it is included in the hashMerkleRoot
  - `coinbase`: Kaspa coinbase transaction

---

### 3. Merge Mining Transaction Verification

The verification of a merge mining transaction in the consensus layer involves:

1. **Validate Transaction Structure:** Ensure the `data` field matches the expected structure for the `mergeMining` method, including padding and encoding.
2. **Verify Proof of Work:**
   - The submitted PoW must meet the minimum difficulty threshold.
   - Check that the PoW is valid and corresponds to the parent chain specified in the transaction.
3. **Verify coinbase transaction**: Confirm that the coinbase is valid and it's hash is included in the `hashMerkleRoot`.
3. **Validate Receiver Address:** Confirm that the `to` address matches the predefined mining smart contract address.
4. **Timestamp Validation:**
   - Retrieve the last recorded timestamp from the Canxium state database for the `receiver` and `chain`.
   - Ensure the submitted `timestamp` is strictly greater than the stored value.
5. **Value Validation:** Confirm that the reward value (`msg.value`) matches the calculated reward based on difficulty and the current decay factor.
6. **Smart Contract Call:** The transaction calls the `mergeMining` function of the mining contract, distributing rewards accordingly.

---

### 4. Merge Mining Reward Mechanism

The reward is distributed among the miner, treasury, and block proposer (coinbase) as follows:

#### Reward Distribution Formula

- **Miner Reward**: `reward = msg.value - fundReward - coinbaseReward`
- **Treasury Reward**: `fundReward = msg.value * treasuryTax / 100`
- **Coinbase Reward**: `coinbaseReward = msg.value * coinbaseTax / 10000`

The reward values are validated within the smart contract to ensure correctness. The contract emits events for each reward distribution:

- `MergeMiningReward` for miner rewards.
- `MergeMiningTaxes` for treasury and coinbase rewards.

#### Decay Factors and Phases

The reward per difficulty decreases over time following predefined phases:

1. **Phase 1** (0-3 days):
   - Initial reward: 0.5 wei/difficulty
   - Daily decay factor: `0.1^(1/(0.5*30))`
2. **Phase 2** (3-115 days):
   - Reward: 0.27 wei/difficulty
   - Daily decay factor: `0.25^(1/(2.0*30))`
3. **Phase 3** (115-5404 days):
   - Reward: 0.022 wei/difficulty
   - Daily decay factor: `0.4^(1/(17.0*30))`

Rewards drop to 0 after the 5404th day.

---

### 5. Mining Smart Contract

The `mergeMining` function handles reward distribution and updates miner timestamps. Key elements include:

1. **Validation Checks:**
   - Ensure `msg.value > 0`.
   - Verify `chain > 0`.
   - Confirm `timestamp > mergeMiningTimestamp[receiver][chain]`.
   - Validate treasury tax is set.
2. **Reward Distribution:**
   - Transfer miner, treasury, and coinbase rewards.
   - Emit appropriate events for logging.
3. **Timestamp Updates:**
   - Update `mergeMiningTimestamp[receiver][chain]` to the new `timestamp`.

#### Smart Contract Code
```solidity
function mergeMining(address receiver, uint16 chain, uint256 timestamp) public payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "invalid merge mining value");
    require(chain > 0, "invalid merge mining chain id");
    require(timestamp > mergeMiningTimestamp[receiver][chain], "invalid merge mining timestamp");
    require(mergeMiningTreasuryTax > 0, "invalid merge mining treasury tax");

    uint256 fundReward = msg.value * mergeMiningTreasuryTax / 100;
    uint256 coinbaseReward = msg.value * coinbaseRewardPercentage(block.timestamp) / 10000;
    uint256 reward = msg.value - fundReward - coinbaseReward;

    payable(receiver).transfer(reward);
    treasuryAddress.transfer(fundReward);
    payable(block.coinbase).transfer(coinbaseReward);

    mergeMiningTimestamp[receiver][chain] = timestamp;

    emit MergeMiningReward(msg.sender, receiver, reward);
    emit MergeMiningTaxes(treasuryAddress, fundReward, block.coinbase, coinbaseReward);
}
```

---

### 6. State Database Interaction

The consensus layer validates merge mining transactions by accessing state data. The process includes:

1. **Retrieve Timestamp from State:**
   - Use the `mergeMiningStorageKey` function to calculate the storage key based on the miner's address and chain ID.
   - Retrieve the timestamp from the state database (`StateDB`).

2. **Validate Transaction Timestamp:**
   - Compare the submitted `timestamp` with the stored timestamp.
   - Reject transactions with `timestamp <= stored timestamp`.

#### Code
```go
func mergeMiningStorageKey(address common.Address, chainID uint16) common.Hash {
    addressBytes := common.LeftPadBytes(address.Bytes(), 32)
    hash := sha3.NewLegacyKeccak256()
    hash.Write(append(addressBytes, MiningContractSlotBytes...))
    outerKeyHash := hash.Sum(nil)

    chainBytes := common.LeftPadBytes(big.NewInt(int64(chainID)).Bytes(), 32)
    hash = sha3.NewLegacyKeccak256()
    hash.Write(append(chainBytes, outerKeyHash...))
    return common.BytesToHash(hash.Sum(nil))
}

func (s *StateDB) GetMergeMiningTimestamp(contract common.Address, address common.Address, chain types.MergeChain) uint64 {
    key := mergeMiningStorageKey(address, uint16(chain))
    data := s.GetState(contract, key)
    return data.Big().Uint64()
}
```

---

### 7. Proof of Work Validation

1. **Minimum Difficulty:** Ensure the PoW meets the minimum difficulty specified for the parent chain.
2. **Proof Validation:** Validate the block's proof-of-work using the `VerifyPoW` method.
3. **Coinbase Validation:** Ensure the block's coinbase transaction matches the miner's Ethereum address.

---

### 8. Error Handling

The following errors are defined and handled during verification:

- **ErrInvalidDifficulty:** Non-positive difficulty in the transaction.
- **ErrInvalidMiningTimeLine:** Merge mining not yet supported for the parent chain.
- **ErrInvalidMiningTxValue:** Incorrect reward value in the transaction.
- **ErrInvalidMiningReceiver:** Invalid receiver address in the transaction.
- **ErrInvalidMergePoW:** Invalid proof of work.
- **ErrInvalidMergeCoinbase:** Invalid coinbase transaction in the block.
